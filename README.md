# US-States---Hexbins
US State features in a uniform Hexbin/hexagonal shape.
------------------------------------------------------

Due to the fact the hexagonal shape is not maintained when the projection is changed, these data sets are supplied in three different spatial reference systems:

- WGS 84 (EPSG: 4326)
- Web Mercator (EPSG:3857)
- National Atlas Equal Area (EPSG: 2163)
  - The KML format will only be posted in Web Mercator
  - The GeoJSON format will only be posted in WGS 84

The attribute tables include each state's name, postal code abbreviation, and FIPS code to facilitate joining your data to the features.

Additional file formats will be uploaded when I have time

Suggestions appreciated
